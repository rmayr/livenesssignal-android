This is a prototype Android app working with the liveness signal server

TODO:
* Support connecting through Tor, with a default INS Tor service pre-configured
* Add "About" and "Help" screens callable from burger menu
* Maybe: Re-enable settings back button
* Maybe: Allow storing appPassword with keystore integration without being protected with biometric unlock?
