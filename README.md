This is a prototype Android app working with the liveness signal server

TODO:
* Add "About" and "Help" screens callable from burger menu
* Maybe: Re-enable settings back button
* Maybe: Allow storing appPassword with keystore integration without being protected with biometric unlock?

Privacy policy:
* We do not collect any sensitive user data. Communication with the liveness signal server operated by the Institute of Networks and Security at Johannes Kepler University Linz uses Tor Onion services, and we therefore cannot technically learn the source IP address or other identifying network information from app clients. The only data items sent to and fetched from the server are hashes derived from random data, with key material provided by the user mixed in. There is no communication without explicit actions initiated by a user.
